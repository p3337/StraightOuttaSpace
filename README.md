## High Score

The High Score is constantly updated. Currently only one record will be saved in
a flash cookie and restored for every new game instance.


## Opponents / AI

Currently the opponents are very stupid: They will shoot only once when they
appear and at a distance of about 400px to the players spaceship.
Their start position is set randomly. The number of opponent spaceships for
every attack is fixed for the first 25 waves, after that this will be set randomly.


## Resources

All resources are made by myself except for all spaceship and laser textures as
